#### You probably want to contribute to the orginal [forge project](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge), this version just contains some minor modifications that generates recipe jsons from the original (1.11) GameRegistry method calls

If you actually want to contribute to this version just keep these things in mind:
- Keep the [code style](https://github.com/HoldYourWaffle/MinecraftForge-1.12-RecipeConvertingAssistance/blob/recipe-assistance/eclipse-codestyle.xml) consistent
- I love all PR's equally, including very small *and* very big ones
- Split your modifications up in logical commits so I can cherry-pick them if I only like certain parts
- Split multiple features up in multiple PR's
